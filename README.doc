# OmegaBot
This is the repo for the OmegaBot: a bot for Discord used by gaming guilds to keep track of raids and their phases, useful when members are spread all over the world in different timezones.

For information on how to use the website and bot, please check the [wiki](https://github.com/shawila/chat-bot/wiki).
